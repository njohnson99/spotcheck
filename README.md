# SpotCheck

SpotCheck is an open-source framework to evaluate blindspot discovery methods ("BDMs").  

* In summary, SpotCheck works by generating "experimental configurations": synthetic image datasets & models with *known* true blindspots.
* In this repository, we release the code we used in our experiments to generate several experimental configurations with different datasets and true blindspot definitions.
* To learn more about SpotCheck, you can read our paper [on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04104)!
